This week's post will be short, but it covers two books I think all engineers should read. These aren't textbooks telling you how to write code but fictional stories with situations you will have experienced. Both books are from award-winning CTO Gene Kim.
<br/>
<br/>
# The Phoenix Project

This book, released in 2013, tells the story of a fictional IT project in a struggling automotive company. The book will introduce you to the three DevOps principles and how the characters use them to bring the project back on track.
<br/>
<br/>
I came across this book while working in Capgemini; our practice lead added it to the recommended reading list and allowed us to expense it. One to never turn down a freebie, I ordered it. It was shipped to my hotel the next day, and I read it from cover to cover over the next two days, and it's been on my recommendation list ever since.

# The Unicorn Project

The Unicorn Project, released in 2019, is a sequel to The Phoniex Project, set in the same company. This time, the focus is on software development and the effects that technical debt and complexity can have on a project.
<br/>
<br/>
After reading his previous book, I was already following Gene Kim, so I jumped on it as soon as it came out. This time in Audible format. With seven years working as an engineer, I have faced the situations discussed here, which made this book super relatable. I recommend reading The Phoenix Project first, as that gives you a lot of the back story of why the project is in trouble a second time.

This series of books is always my default recommendation for someone looking to learn more about how software and projects work. If you do pick them up, I would like to know your thoughts, and I'm always on the lookout for even more recommendations if you have any.
